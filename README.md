# MRI - Assesment

## Description
I created this website in response to MRI's assessment prompt, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Images were created using Adobe Express, and finding images on Google. I used the Pure framework to assist in creating a cleaner input form.

## Goals
- [x] Retrieve and Display user account info
- [x] Retrieve and Display previous submissions
- [x] 1 Entry per day
- [x] Create a responsive design

## Thought process
--- 

During the creation of this project I needed to overcome a few challenges,
1. I was unfamiliar with creating a 24hour timer, that would not allow the user to create more than one entry.

    - My initial thoughts went to storing the entry in the local storage, This was how I was able to track the users submission.

2. Only 1 instant win per entrant.
    
    - I was able to accomplish this by creating a simple loop that would change the variable "hasWonBefore" if a previous entry has already won.

3. Design

    - Sadly, I was unable to design the website to be what I initially envisioned it to be. I had to work during the past 2 days, and I prioritized functionality over styling. I decided to create a simple 1-page screen that displayed all the information.

## Personal Notes:
---
If given more time, I would have liked to create more personalized images and also utilize Phosphor icons.

If I were to revise this project, I would create an account page instead of having John Smith's information and the code submission all on the same page.

Through this project, I realized I needed to spend more time studying CSS. I was taught to prioritize functionality, and as much as I agree with that, I would love to learn how to create more visually pleasing sites.
